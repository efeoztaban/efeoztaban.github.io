Hello there! I'm Efe Öztaban, currently pursuing my Master's in Physics at Sabancı University. I completed my Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering with a double major in Computer Science and a minor in Physics. This interdisciplinary education has allowed me to explore the fascinating intersections of engineering, computer science, and astrophysics.

I've had the privilege to work on some exciting projects. During my internship at DTU Space in Denmark, I contributed to the bootloader design for the ATHENA mission's Wide Field Imager, diving deep into instrumentation and space technologies. Back at Sabancı University's HEALAB, I worked on developing an improved X-ray detector for the Sharjah-Sat-1 CubeSat mission, which is launched in 2022. Currently, I'm studying dust scattering halos and the 3D morphology of interstellar molecular clouds using machine learning. I had the opportunity to present my research at the International Conference on Machine Learning for Astrophysics in Italy in July 2024.

In this era of rapidly expanding astrophysical data, I'm passionate about applying machine learning to astrophysical research. In my free time, I enjoy radio broadcasting, cooking, traveling, and exploring cinema. I'm excited to continue my journey in observational astrophysics and artificial intelligence, combining my technical skills with my curiosity about the universe.
