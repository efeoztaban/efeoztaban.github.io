Hey there! I’m Efe Öztaban, currently pursuing my Master’s in Physics at Sabancı University, where I also completed my Bachelor’s in Electronics Engineering with a double major in Computer Science. My journey has taken me through the fascinating intersections of machine learning and astrophysics, where I’ve been diving into projects like figuring out the 3D shapes of interstellar clouds and constrainting a black hole's distance. I’m all about using AI and data science to uncover the mysteries of the universe.
